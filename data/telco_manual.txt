Title: Telco AI Knowledge Base for Network Troubleshooting Assistant

1. Core Mission
The goal is to minimize network downtime and reduce trouble-ticket resolution time by enabling engineers to “Talk to Your Network” using natural language.

2. Key Data Sources for Troubleshooting
- System logs and device logs
- Alarms and alerts
- KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
- Configuration files and parameters
- Trouble tickets (structured + unstructured notes)
- CRM and customer complaint data
- Equipment vendor manuals

3. Common Root Causes (frequent in real networks)
- Configuration errors or mismatches
- Interface flaps / ISIS or BGP neighbor drops
- Capacity exhaustion (radio, transport, core)
- Hardware faults or degradation
- Software bugs after upgrade
- External factors (fiber cut, power outage)
- Overloaded or misconfigured load balancers / firewalls

4. Recommended Actions by Symptom
Connection slow or high latency → Check interface utilization, retransmissions, buffer drops, QoS policy.
Packet loss or interface down → Verify physical layer, run hardware diagnostics, check neighbor state.
Sudden KPI degradation → Compare with baseline, look for recent config changes or upgrades.
Repeated alarms on same NE → Likely hardware issue → trigger predictive maintenance.
Customer reports “no service” → Correlate complaint location with cell/outage map.

5. LLM Best Practices in Telco Environment
- Always use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with internal documents to prevent hallucinations.
- Prefer smaller, fine-tuned or domain-adapted models (SLM/MLM) over giant generic models.
- Enforce explainability: every answer must cite the source (log snippet, alarm, manual section).
- Security: never send real customer data or PII to public APIs.

6. Important Acronyms and Terminology
RCA  = Root Cause Analysis  
NSO  = Network that Self-Operates  
LNA  = Large Network Agent (high-level coordinator)  
NMA  = Network Module Agent (RAN, Core, Transport, Optical)  
SemCom = Semantic Communications (transmit meaning/intent, not raw data)  
TLLM = Telco-specific Large Language Model  
GTAA = Global Telecom AI Alliance

7. Example Troubleshooting Dialogue
User: “Cell 12345 has high drop rate since 02:00”
Assistant: Retrieved alarm “ISIS neighbor down on interface Te7/0/0” at 01:58. Config change detected at 01:45 (MTU mismatch after upgrade). Recommended action: rollback MTU or adjust neighbor config, then clear ISIS adjacency.

8. Predictive Maintenance Triggers
- Unusual rise in CRC errors → schedule fiber or hardware check
- Temperature alarms trending upward → plan cooling maintenance
- Retransmission rate > 3 % over 24 h → investigate radio interference or capacity

9. Zero-Touch & Intent-Based Principles
Customer says “I need more bandwidth for my office” → LLM translates intent → agentic workflow provisions extra bearer automatically without manual tickets.

10. Hallucination Mitigation Rules
- Never invent log entries or alarm IDs.
- If context does not contain the answer, respond “I don’t have sufficient information in the current logs.”
- Always reference the retrieved document or log line.
